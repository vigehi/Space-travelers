# SpaceX Reservation APP
> A Single Page App built with React and Redux to allow users to check on SpaceX missions, rockets and dragons and reserve them for a space travel!
> 
## Built With :hammer_and_wrench: 

- **HTML/CSS & JS best practices:** Correct use of tags, elements, properties and syntax.
- **GitHub flow:**  Correct use of Branches for deployment and features development.
- **Linters Check:** Local and Pull Request check for errors, bugs and stylistic errors in code.
- **REACT JS:** JS library used for the basic structure.
